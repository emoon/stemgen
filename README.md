# stemgen

STEM generator using libopenmpt with glue in Rust

# Building

Download Rust by following the instructions here https://rustup.rs
Notice that a C++ toolchain needs to be installed along with Cmake as well. On Windows this means Visual Studo 2019 or later and on Linux or macOS clang or gcc.

`cargo build --release`

And to run

`cargo run --release -- <parameters>`

or just run directly from

`target/release/stemgen`

after building the release config
